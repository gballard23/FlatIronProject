# FlatIronProject

SUMMARY:
This application is a MVP for searching specific MCU movie/series titles. When searched you will recieve the Title, Director, Producer, Star, and release date for the film. 


My main goals of this project were:
1.A nice background image that gives you a look at most of the MCU prominent characters. My favorite being the hulk.
2.An easy setup for with a search thats straight to the point.
3.Have not just the title pop up but something to have that Marvel feel to it as a big fan of Stan lee.


When the search is completed a Marvel logo gif will pop up with the film info and the well known MCU theme music will play.
